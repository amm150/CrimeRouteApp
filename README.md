CrimeRouteApp is a React Native application for providing geographical crime data and maps.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

Open [http://localhost:19003/](http://localhost:19003/) to view the Expo Development Tools.

You can select to run the app in a web browser, IOS simulator, or Android device through these Development Tools.

You can also open the app through a client by downloading the Expo Client app on Android and IOS.

### `npm run android`

Runs the app in an Android Simulator.

### `npm run ios`

### `npm run web`

Runs the app in an a web browser.
Open [http://localhost:19006/](http://localhost:19006/) to view the app in a web browser.

### `npm run build:android`

Builds the android app for production using Expo. Open [https://expo.io/accounts/[username]/builds](https://expo.io/) to view the queued build.

You must have an Expo account in order to create the android build.

### `npm run build:ios`

Builds the ios app for production using Expo. Open [https://expo.io/accounts/[username]/builds](https://expo.io/) to view the queued build.

You must have an Expo account in order to create the android build.

### `npm run build:web`

Builds the android app for production to the `web-build` folder

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
